# Overview

**Jupyter MCP Server** is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server implementation that provides interaction with 📓 Jupyter Notebooks running in any JupyterLab or Notebook>7.

It also works with your 💻 local Jupyter and with the Datalayer hosted Notebooks.

Key features include:

- ⚡ **Real-time control:** Instantly view notebook changes as they happen.
- 🔁 **Smart execution:** Automatically adjusts when a cell run fails thanks to cell output feedback.
- 🤝 **MCP-Compatible:** Works with any MCP client, such as [Claude Desktop](/clients/claude_desktop), [Cursor](/clients/cursor), [Cline](/clients/cline), [Windsurf](/clients/windsurf) and more.

To use Jupyter MCP Server, your first need a running Jupyter Notebook (provided by [Datalayer](/datalayer) or by the OSS [Jupyter](/jupyter) (JupyterLab or Notebook>6).

Then you need to [configure](/clients) your MCP client:

1. With `stdio`, your client will launch the MCP server for you, so you the default configuraiton is often enough. The server will be pulled from Docker Hub.
2. With `streamable-http`, you need to [run yourself a Jupyter MCP Server](/run) (on your machine or in the cloud), so you'd better look at the [fine-grained configuration details](/server-configuration) of your server.

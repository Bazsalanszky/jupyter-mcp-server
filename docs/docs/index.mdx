# Overview

**Jupyter MCP Server** is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server implementation that provides interaction with 📓 Jupyter notebooks running in any JupyterLab. It also works with your 💻 local JupyterLab.

Key features include:

- ⚡ **Real-time control:** Instantly view notebook changes as they happen.
- 🔁 **Smart execution:** Automatically adjusts when a cell run fails thanks to cell output feedback.
- 🤝 **MCP-Compatible:** Works with any MCP client, such as [Claude Desktop](./claude_desktop), [Cursor](./cursor), [Cline](./cline), [Windsurf](./windsurf) and more.

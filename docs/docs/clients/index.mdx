# Clients

We have tested and validated the Jupyter MCP Server with the following clients:
  - [Claude Desktop](./claude_desktop)
  - [Cursor](./cursor)
  - [Cline](./cline)
  - [Windsurf](./windsurf)

BUT this server is compatible with **any** MCP client â€” see the growing list in [MCP clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients). This means that you are **not** limited to the clients listed above.
